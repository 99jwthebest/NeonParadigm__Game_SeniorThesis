## Project Description
This project is a senior thesis developed for the University of the Incarnate Word (UIW), where I created an engaging hack-and-slash rhythm game using Unreal Engine C++/Blueprint. In the game, the player must press inputs on the beat, and the player's attacks must land on the beat to maximize effectiveness. This creates a dynamic and immersive gameplay experience, where timing and rhythm are essential for success.

The game integrates FMOD for dynamic audio handling, syncing music with in-game events to enhance the overall experience. Players will feel immersed in the game world as their actions, from attacks to movement, are in sync with the soundtrack.

Additionally, I designed and implemented custom shaders to enhance visual effects, creating stunning visuals that complement the fast-paced, rhythmic gameplay. The combination of rhythm-based mechanics, responsive audio, and striking visual effects creates a unique and engaging experience for players.

This project demonstrates a strong blend of technical and creative skills, including advanced gameplay programming, audio integration, and visual design within Unreal Engine.
