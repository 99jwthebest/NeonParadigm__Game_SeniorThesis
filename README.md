## 📌 Project Description

**Neon Paradigm** is a senior thesis project developed at the **University of the Incarnate Word**. Built in **Unreal Engine using C++ and Blueprints**, the game combines hack-and-slash action with rhythm mechanics. Players must perform attacks, dodges, and movements **on the beat** to maximize damage, combos, and style.

The goal was to explore how music, timing, and feedback can merge into a deeply responsive combat system that rewards rhythm and precision.
